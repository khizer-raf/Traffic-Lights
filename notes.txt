two traffic lights, a queue for each traffic light 

when a light is green, it's corresponding queue should be empty

if a light is red, it's queue is checked regularly for cars waiting

if there are cars, the other light is turned red and the current light is turned green

every time there the state of the lights change, there is a 5 second buffer to avoid the lights instantly switching back and forth during high volume traffic
